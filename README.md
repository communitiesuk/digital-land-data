These datasets have been collected and transformed by hand using [GDAL](http://www.gdal.org/) and other conversion scripts in the [bin](bin) and [lib](lib) directories.

We recommend working in [virtual environment](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/) before installing the python dependencies:

    $ make init

The process of refreshing the data is being automated as a pipeline of [luigi](https://github.com/spotify/luigi) tasks:

    $ make
