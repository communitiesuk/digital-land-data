Under the Town and Country Planning (General Development Procedure) Order 1995 Local Planning Authorities have to consult with the Environment Agency about all applications they receive to develop land within 250 metres of landfill sites (including any land that has been used as a landfill site within the past 30 years or is likely to be used as one in the near future). The Historic Landfill dataset was created to help fulfil our statutory responsibility to Local Planning Authorities by supplying information on the risks posed by landfill sites for development within 250m. The data is the most comprehensive and consistent national historic landfill dataset and defines the location of, and provides specific attributes for, known historic (closed) landfill sites, i.e. sites where there is no PPC permit or waste management licence currently in force. This includes sites that existed before the waste licensing regime and sites that have been licensed in the past but where this licence has been revoked, ceased to exist or surrendered and a certificate of completion has been issued. Historic Landfill includes all relevant historic information for the sites that both local authorities and the Environment Agency have collected over the years.
